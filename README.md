# StellarEscrow
### Trustless Milestone-Based Freelance Payment Escrow on Stellar

---

## 📖 Overview

StellarEscrow addresses the critical challenge of trust in the digital freelance economy. In traditional freelance arrangements, clients risk paying for incomplete or low-quality work, while freelancers risk non-payment after dedicating time and resources to a project. StellarEscrow solves this friction by utilizing decentralized, milestone-based smart contracts built on Stellar's Soroban platform. 

By locking project funds in a secure, decentralized escrow contract, clients demonstrate financial commitment upfront. Freelancers can verify that the funds are secured on-chain before commencing work. The locked capital is released progressively as milestones are completed, reviewed, and approved. A dedicated arbiter role ensures fair dispute resolution, protecting both parties.

Designed for freelancers, independent contractors, small agencies, and clients, StellarEscrow combines the security and transparency of decentralized finance with a user-friendly, responsive interface. It offers a smooth onboarding experience that hides the complexities of Web3 transactions behind standard user flows, ensuring accessibility for non-technical users.

    end
```

### Milestone State Machine

Milestone progress is governed by a finite state machine enforced by the smart contract:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created : client.create_project()
    Created --> Funded : client.fund_milestone()
    Funded --> Submitted : freelancer.submit_milestone()
    Submitted --> Approved : client.approve_milestone()
    Submitted --> Disputed : client/freelancer.dispute_milestone()
    
    Disputed --> Released : arbiter.resolve_dispute(Release)
    Disputed --> Refunded : arbiter.resolve_dispute(Refund)
    
    Created --> Refunded : client.refund_milestone() (unfunded & expired)
    Funded --> Refunded : freelancer.refund_milestone() (voluntary cancel)
    
    Approved --> [*]
    Released --> [*]
    Refunded --> [*]
```

*   **Created**: Milestone metadata is saved on-chain but no funds are committed.
*   **Funded**: The client deposits and locks XLM into the contract. It is now safe for the freelancer to work.
*   **Submitted**: Freelancer uploads deliverables and marks the milestone as complete.
*   **Approved**: Client accepts deliverables and releases funds to the freelancer's wallet address.
*   **Disputed**: Funds are locked because of a performance conflict, awaiting arbitration.
*   **Refunded**: Funds are returned to the client (due to voluntary cancellation by the freelancer, expiry of an unfunded milestone, or arbiter resolution).

## 📜 Smart Contract Details

*   **Network**: Stellar Testnet
*   **Deployed Contract Address**: `CABRYRJWNR5WVI34LSA667LTXG7NHIRJOAZASX5MTFJK5JHCAD7ILETJ`
*   **Stellar Expert Link**: [View Contract on Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CABRYRJWNR5WVI34LSA667LTXG7NHIRJOAZASX5MTFJK5JHCAD7ILETJ)

### Contract Interface Functions

*   `create_project(client: Address, freelancer: Address, arbiter: Address, milestones: Vec<MilestoneInput>) -> u64`
    *   Initializes a project with a list of milestone inputs and returns a unique Project ID.
*   `fund_milestone(project_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32, client: Address)`
    *   Locks the milestone amount in XLM from the client's wallet into the escrow contract.
*   `submit_milestone(project_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32, freelancer: Address)`
    *   Updates the milestone status to `Submitted`, indicating the work is ready for client approval.
*   `approve_milestone(project_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32, client: Address)`
    *   Releases the locked XLM for the milestone, transferring it directly to the freelancer's address.
*   `dispute_milestone(project_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32, caller: Address)`
    *   Flags the milestone as disputed, locking the funds until resolved.
*   `resolve_dispute(project_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32, arbiter: Address, resolve_to_client: bool)`
    *   Called by the arbiter to release locked funds to either the client (refund) or freelancer (release).
*   `refund_milestone(project_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32, caller: Address)`
    *   Performs refunds for expired unfunded milestones or voluntary freelancer cancellations.
*   `get_project(project_id: u64) -> Project`
    *   Retrieves project details, addresses, and overall configuration.
*   `get_milestones(project_id: u64) -> Vec<Milestone>`
    *   Returns the list of all milestones and their current states for a given project.

### Storage Optimization Choices
StellarEscrow utilizes a hybrid storage architecture in Soroban to optimize storage fees and prevent state expiration:
* **Instance Storage** is used to store core configuration metadata (such as the native asset contract ID) that is queried frequently by the contract and occupies minimal state space.
* **Persistent Storage** is used for project details and milestone states (`Project`, `Milestone`), ensuring that this long-term state remains permanently on the ledger and does not expire while funds are locked in active escrows.

## 🔄 Product Iteration Based on Feedback

Based on the feedback collected during the Level 4 MVP phase, the following key improvements were implemented for this Level 5 release:

| Feedback Theme | What Users Said (Summary) | Change Made | Git Commit Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Form Errors** | "Transactions randomly fail if I paste an invalid wallet address." | Added real-time Stellar address validation to the Create Project form. | [GITHUB_COMMIT_LINK] |
| **Terminology** | "I don't know what 'Funded' vs 'Created' means for my money." | Added native tooltips to milestone status badges for non-crypto users. | [GITHUB_COMMIT_LINK] |
| **Growth/Sharing** | "It's hard to tell my freelancer where to find the project I just funded." | Added a 'Copy Invite Link' button to easily share the project URL. | [GITHUB_COMMIT_LINK] |
| **Onboarding Friction** | "I didn't know I needed to get test XLM from Friendbot first." | Added an interactive "How it Works" modal before wallet connection. | [GITHUB_COMMIT_LINK] |
| **Deadlines** | "I have to calculate timestamps in my head to know if I'm late." | Introduced dynamic status badges (e.g., "Due in 3 days", "Overdue"). | [GITHUB_COMMIT_LINK] |

*(Author note: Update the `[GITHUB_COMMIT_LINK]` placeholders with the actual URLs from your repository commits!)*

## 🛣️ Next Phase Roadmap (Level 6 & Beyond)

While Level 5 scales our testnet user base, the long-term vision requires bridging the gap to real-world value:
1. **Stellar Mainnet Deployment**: Migrating the contract to Mainnet and securing an audit.
2. **Stellar Anchor Integration**: Directly integrating fiat-on-ramps (e.g. USDC) so non-crypto clients can fund escrow projects using credit cards.
3. **Dispute Resolution DAO**: Moving away from a single hardcoded arbiter to a decentralized jury for disputes.

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Event Telemetry
We use **PostHog** to monitor operations, track metrics, and evaluate DApp usability. The following custom actions are tracked:
*   `wallet_connected`: Triggered when users connect Freighter.
*   `project_created`: Logs successful on-chain project creation.
*   `milestone_funded`: Emitted when clients lock funds.
*   `milestone_submitted`: Captured when freelancers present deliverables.
*   `milestone_approved`: Dispatched when funds are released.
*   `milestone_disputed`: Sent when a dispute is opened.

### Error Tracking & Stability
We have integrated **Sentry** to capture client-side runtime errors. Sentry logs:
*   Rejected browser signature requests.
*   Network disconnection warnings or RPC failure timeouts.
*   Validation errors in project configurations.

## 🧪 Testing

### Smart Contract Tests
Smart contract logic is tested using Rust's built-in cargo testing framework.
To run tests:
```bash
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/escrow_contract/Cargo.toml --target-dir target_test -j 1
```
These tests cover:
*   Milestone state transitions (Created $\rightarrow$ Funded $\rightarrow$ Submitted $\rightarrow$ Approved).
*   Enforcement of client-only permissions for funding and approvals.
*   Dispute arbitration flows and correct token disbursement.
*   Prevention of double-funding or double-release.

### Frontend Application Tests
Unit and integration tests for frontend React utilities and services are configured.
To run frontend tests:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```
These tests verify:
*   Correct formatting of XLM amounts to Stroops.
*   Validation check logic for milestones (deadlines in the future, positive amounts).
*   Proper rendering of the dashboard lists based on mock state variables.
